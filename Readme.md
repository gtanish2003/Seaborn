# Seaborn
Seaborn is a powerful data visualization library in Python that is built on top of Matplotlib. It provides a high-level interface for creating attractive and informative statistical graphics. Seaborn is particularly useful for visualizing complex datasets with multiple variables.



# 1. Relational Plot
Relational plots are used for bivariate analysis, exploring the relationship between two variables.

### Scatter Plot     
### Line Plot

# 2. Distribution Plot
Distribution plots are used for univariate analysis, visualizing the distribution of a single variable.

### Histogram

### KDE Plot

### Rug Plot

# 3. Matrix Plot
Matrix plots are used for visualizing the relationships between multiple variables.

### Heatmap
### Clustermap


# 4. Categorical Plot
Categorical plots in seaborn provide a visual representation of the relationship between one categorical variable and one or more numerical variables, helping to analyze and understand patterns in data.
## Categorical scatter plots
### stripplot
### swarmplot

## Categorical distribution plots
### boxplot
### violinplot

## Categorical estimate plots
### pointplot
### barplot
### countplot

# figure level function --> catplot

# 5. Regression Plots
Seaborn regression plots visualize the relationship between two variables using statistical models, providing a clear and concise representation of trends and patterns in the data
### regplot
### lmplot
### residplot

# 6. Grid Plots
Seaborn's grid plots provide a convenient way to visualize relationships between multiple variables through various grid-based layouts.
### FacetGrid
### PairGrid
### JointGrid
